# Deirrorz Tuning Advertisement

# Description

I am currently developing a Go web application that provides user authentication, token management, and access to information such as news and an 'About Us' page. 

The app also includes a dedicated page that describes desktop applications available for download, which allow users to perform software tuning and make differences on automobile software directly on their desktop (EXE clients). 

The web services now handle authentication and database-related functionality, while the EXE clients take care of the actual difference algorithm.

# Progress

Currently, the project is not fully production-ready. The frontend and backend API are completed, but further work is still ongoing. Due to copyright protection, the code will not be shared at this stage.

I have created also the offline versions of the desktop application a few years ago and more information about them can be found [here](https://github.com/Deirror/DOOMz). I plan to make them communicate with HTTPS with the Go backend for managing database, authentication and tokens.

# Tech Stack

The following technologies are and will be used for building into production mode:
-

- Render(later moving to Google Cloud Platform(GCP))
- Redis for caching JWT(Upstash)
- Postgres for main relational database(Neon.tech)
- Cloudflare for security
- Stripe for payment services(tokens)
- Google OAuth for beeter user experience
