# Deirrorz Tuning Advertisement

I am currently developing a Go web application that provides user authentication, token management, and access to information such as news and an 'About Us' page. 
The app also includes a dedicated page that describes desktop applications available for download, which allow users to perform software tuning and make differences on car software directly on their desktop (EXE clients). 
The web services now handle authentication and database-related functionality, while the EXE clients take care of the actual difference algorithm.

Currently, the project is not fully production-ready. The frontend and backend API are completed, but further work is still ongoing. Due to copyright protection, the code will not be shared at this stage.
